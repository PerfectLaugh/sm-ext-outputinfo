# sm-ext-outputinfo
Original plugin by LivingInPortal: https://github.com/LivingInPortal/sm-ext-outputinfo

I've updated the extension and added some more functionality. 
The extension now supports getting the amount of times to fire an action, and can also set the values of any of the fields of the actions.
You can also add or remove actions (currently only supported on windows).
